#### 10-601 Machine Learning

#### 11-364 An Introduction to Knowledge-Based Deep Learning and Socratic Coaches
The course will explore knowledge-based deep learning, a new methodology invented by the instructor that offers many potential advantages over conventional deep learning. This is a learn-by-doing, team-project based course.

#### 11-661 Language and Statistics
The goal of "Language and Statistics" is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology. We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier). We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language. 

#### 11-691 Math for Machine Learning

#### 11-755 / 18-797 Machine Learning for Signal Processing
This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems. 

#### 11-756 [Theory and Practice of Speech Recognition Systems](http://asr.cs.cmu.edu/spring2013/)
We present voice recognition systems through the perspective of a novice. Beginning from the very simple problem of matching two strings, we present the algorithms and techniques as a series of intuitive and logical increments, until we arrive at a fully functional continuous speech recognition system.

#### 11-775 Large-Scale Multimedia Analysis

#### 11-785 / 11-485 Introduction to Deep Learning
In this course we will learn about the basics of deep neural networks, and their applications to various AI tasks. By the end of the course, it is expected that students will have significant familiarity with the subject, and to be able to apply to them to a variety of tasks. They will also be positioned to understand much of the current literature on the topic and extend their knowledge through further study.
